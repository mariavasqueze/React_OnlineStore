# React / Redux Online Store

Using React I built an online clothing store. User authentication and the
product database is in Firebase. The checkout page uses Stripe to complete
payments. All actions of the page are processed with Redux, to see this,
check the console when using the page.

## Techs used:
 - JavaScript
 - React
 - Redux 
 - Firebase
 - CSS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
